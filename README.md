The project includes various modules and examples to demonstrate object recognition using CNN and image processing techniques. You can run these examples to see the system in action or customize them to fit your specific needs.

  ``` 
python examples/object_recognition.py
python examples/image_preprocessing.py
  ```

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation provided in the docs folder.


## Examples

Here are some basic examples to get you started:

* Object Recognition

    ``` 
   from recognition.cnn_model import CNNModel
   cnn_model = CNNModel()
   cnn_model.load_model('models/object_recognition_model.h5')
   result = cnn_model.predict('images/test_image.jpg')
   print(f"Recognized Object: {result}") 
  ``` 

* Image Preprocessing

  ``` 
   from processing.image_preprocessor import ImagePreprocessor
   image_preprocessor = ImagePreprocessor()
   preprocessed_image = image_preprocessor.process('images/raw_image.jpg')
   preprocessed_image.show()
    ```
